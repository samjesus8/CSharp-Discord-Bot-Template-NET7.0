# Welcome

## ***THIS IS THE NET 7.0 VERSION OF THE ORIGINAL TEMPLATE REPOSITORY***

This repository acts as a template for people wanting to create their own Discord Bot using C#

By using this template, you are able to create an empty Discord Bot framework where you can start coding any commands and features
you want based on the theme of your Bot

You can also use this repository to test new features in a test environment before you release it to your actual bot

## A Message to Beginners

This repository's only existence is to act as a solid foundation for Beginners or for Testers. It is the user's responsibility to research & learn
for themselves, how to use the D# library and code good quality commands 

***As programmers, do not expect the answers to just be handed to you on a plate. You are expected to research and study for yourself
things that you may not understand about Discord Bots***
